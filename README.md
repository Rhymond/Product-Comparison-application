# Product Comparison application

Using **Lumen** to serve the application, and **ReactJS** for the front-end, build a simple product comparison application using the data in the provided.


The initial page load should just display the products in a simple multi-selectable list. Beneath the list, display a comparison section, which will render each of the product details side by side once selected.

When a product is selected from the list it should appear in the comparison section, when itâ€™s unselected it should disappear.

For each product we expect to see:

* Name
* Image (images provided)
* Categories
* Balance Transfer Rates
* Money Transfer Rates
* Purchase Rates
* Additional Info
* More Info Button
